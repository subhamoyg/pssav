# PSSAV (Process Scheduling Simulation, Analyzer, and Visualization) #

Process Scheduling Simulation, Analyzer, and Visualization (PSSAV) is an application providing CPU process scheduling algorithm simulation.

Some features currently implemented in PSSAV are:
  * Animation of CPU scheduling activities
  * Customizable comparison between each scheduling algorithm;
  * Customizable process configurations;
  * Simulation of more than one round-robin algorithm each with different time quantum value;
  * Data are represented in tabular form and chart.
  * Supported scheduling algorithm:
    * FCFS
    * SJF (preemptive dan non-preemptive)
    * Priority (preemptive dan non-preemptive)
    * Round-robin
